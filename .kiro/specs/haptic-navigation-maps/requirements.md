# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an iOS maps application with a unique "in-pocket" navigation mode that uses haptic feedback for directions. The application will provide standard mapping functionality enhanced with innovative haptic navigation capabilities, allowing users to navigate without looking at their screen. The design will be created using Figma components to ensure consistency and high-quality user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standard Map Display and Location Services

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a map with my current location displayed, so that I can see where I am and plan my navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a map centered on the user's current location
2. WHEN location permissions are requested THEN the system SHALL request appropriate location permissions (when in use and background)
3. IF location permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and fallback functionality
4. WHEN the user's location changes THEN the system SHALL update the location indicator on the map in real-time

### Requirement 2: Location Search and Destination Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for destinations and select them on the map, so that I can plan routes to specific locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the search bar THEN the system SHALL display a search interface
2. WHEN the user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL return relevant location results using MKLocalSearch
3. WHEN the user selects a search result THEN the system SHALL display the location on the map with an annotation
4. WHEN a destination is selected THEN the system SHALL provide options to start navigation to that location

### Requirement 3: Route Calculation and Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the calculated route to my destination displayed on the map, so that I can understand the path I will take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a destination is selected THEN the system SHALL calculate the optimal route using MKDirections
2. WHEN a route is calculated THEN the system SHALL display the route path on the map using MapPolyline
3. WHEN displaying a route THEN the system SHALL show estimated travel time and distance
4. IF no route can be calculated THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN multiple route options are available THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select their preferred route

### Requirement 4: Turn-by-Turn Visual Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want step-by-step visual navigation instructions, so that I can follow the route to my destination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation starts THEN the system SHALL display turn-by-turn instructions based on MKRoute steps
2. WHEN the user progresses along the route THEN the system SHALL update instructions in real-time
3. WHEN approaching a turn THEN the system SHALL provide advance notice with clear visual indicators
4. WHEN the destination is reached THEN the system SHALL display arrival confirmation
5. WHEN navigation is active THEN the system SHALL continuously track user location and route progress

### Requirement 5: Haptic Navigation Mode

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate using haptic feedback without looking at my screen, so that I can keep my phone in my pocket while walking or cycling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN haptic navigation mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL use CoreHaptics to provide navigation cues
2. WHEN a left turn is approaching THEN the system SHALL trigger a distinct single haptic pattern
3. WHEN a right turn is approaching THEN the system SHALL trigger a distinct double haptic pattern
4. WHEN continuing straight THEN the system SHALL provide gentle continuous haptic feedback
5. WHEN the destination is reached THEN the system SHALL trigger a celebratory haptic pattern
6. WHEN haptic navigation is active THEN the system SHALL monitor location and trigger haptics based on route progress
7. IF haptic feedback is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to audio or visual cues

### Requirement 6: Figma-Based Design System

**User Story:** As a designer/developer, I want to use Figma components for consistent UI design, so that the app maintains visual consistency and professional appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the app THEN the system SHALL use a comprehensive Figma component library
2. WHEN implementing UI elements THEN the system SHALL translate Figma designs to SwiftUI components
3. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent colors, fonts, and spacing from Figma
4. WHEN creating new screens THEN the system SHALL follow the established design system patterns

### Requirement 7: Navigation Mode Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily switch between visual and haptic navigation modes, so that I can choose the most appropriate navigation method for my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in navigation mode THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to switch between visual and haptic modes
2. WHEN haptic mode is selected THEN the system SHALL display a simplified interface optimized for pocket use
3. WHEN visual mode is selected THEN the system SHALL display full navigation interface with map and instructions
4. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation state and continue route guidance

### Requirement 8: Background Location and Haptic Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want navigation to continue working when the app is in the background, so that I can use haptic navigation with my phone locked or in my pocket.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation is active THEN the system SHALL continue location tracking in background mode
2. WHEN the app is backgrounded during navigation THEN the system SHALL continue providing haptic feedback
3. WHEN haptic patterns are triggered THEN the system SHALL ensure they work regardless of app state
4. IF background permissions are revoked THEN the system SHALL notify the user and request re-authorization
